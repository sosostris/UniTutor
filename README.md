Mockup for UniTutor UI

UniTutor is a web platform that aims to connect junior and senior students in the same study program at the same university.
It consists of a social forum, a Q&A forum and a tutoring session booking service.

This mockup uses W3.CSS framework and JQuery.

On Tutor's calendar view, only date 30 is mocked up and can be 'booked'.
On user calendar view, among all 'booked' dates, marked by green, only date 5 gives the right details.
On user calendar view, clicking date 30 will mock-up making a new booking on that date.
